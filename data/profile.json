  "bio": "Hi! I am a graduate of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), where I completed my Bachelor's degree with honors in February 2025. Following graduation, I worked as a Research Assistant on the Edge Project under the Research and Innovation Centre (RIC), BUET. Later, I decided to pursue a teaching career and joined the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at BRAC University as a Lecturer. My undergraduate thesis, supervised by Dr. <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=p-w4hOUAAAAJ&hl=en' target='_blank'>Rifat Shahriyar</a>, sparked my interest in research with Software Engineering. Over time, my teaching and research experiences have strengthened my interest in the intersection of Programming Languages and Software Engineering, particularly in using Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist software development tasks such as sensitive information detection. My long-term goal is to conduct advanced research that bridges Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering (AI4SE) to develop intelligent tools that improve developer productivity and software reliability.",
